# Task 1: Software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

I finished manual testing courses, but I want to gain knowledge in automation testing. I strive to stay up-to-date in the testing and match the company's requirements.
I aim to improve my skills and move towards "my best project".
